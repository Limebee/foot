# How It's Made

Tech Used: HTML, Javascript, Tailwind

This app is styled using tailwind. The app uses the SportsDB api to retrieve data about soccer players. The api is called using javascript.

# Optimizations

I would like to add a aearch results page when a user searches for a player. Also, I want each player to have a page showing their information.

# Lessons Learned
I learn more about working with apis snd how to call them. This project allowed me to get more familiar with using Postman. It allowed me to learn to test apis.
